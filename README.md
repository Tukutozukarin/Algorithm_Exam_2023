# Algorithm_Exam_2023

Algorithm and data structure exam february 2023.

Exercise 02:
So the new modified undirected graph will now find the shortest path from starting station,
then it will look for the nearest path to a station with ski in that station.
It will also be able to show all the available paths and from start to stations with ski in the transport network.
So you can check which stations you would like to go to.


Exercise 05:
The ordering of submitted entry is not similar to example input. I will follow the example inputs prosecure, since thats how it will be tested.
Where unique-id (student id) will be placed on second input, not third.
In addition, the unique-id in the first example input is not the same like the others. Based of my
observation it seems like it shouldÂ´ve been same, so i will write the same unique id(from x example input)
when testing exercise 05.
